## üîß Automated Security Scanning

### GitHub CodeQL Integration
This repository is configured with automated GitHub CodeQL analysis that:

- **Runs on every push** to main branch
- **Analyzes pull requests** for security issues
- **Scheduled weekly scans** every Monday at 15:00 UTC
- **Generates SARIF reports** for compliance and integration

### Viewing Results
1. **GitHub Security Tab:** [Code Scanning Alerts](https://github.com/MYounas126/openmrs-core-security-analysis/security/code-scanning)
2. **Actions Tab:** Download SARIF files and view detailed logs
3. **Pull Requests:** Inline security comments and alerts

### Configuration
- **Query Suite:** `security-and-quality` (comprehensive security and quality checks)
- **Language:** Java
- **Focus Areas:** API, web, and module code
- **Exclusions:** Test files, documentation, build artifacts
